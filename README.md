# IntroToCS2-Projects
These are all the projects I completed in a Computer Science class I took at Bellevue College (equivalent to Intro to CS II at most colleges) in the winter quarter of 2023.

**Project 1** - The goal was to create a new class that extends the built in Random Class. It's purpose, according to our professor, was to have students use and learn about inheritance. 

**Project 2** - The goal of this project was to learn how to take advantage of online APIs, in this case JSON and the Google Maps API. 

**Project 3** - Project three's goal was to write a program that takes in a real math expression, turn it into postfix notation, and evaluate it using this notation. 

**Project 4** - For Project 4, we had to create our own Min Heap Data Structure (not as complex as priority queue, but it does keep the Min heap ordered, and has a few simple functions such as remove, add, swap, etc.).
