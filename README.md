# Java Class Projects
These are all the projects I completed in a Computer Science class I took at Bellevue College in the winter quarter of 2023.

**Weather & Map** - The goal of this project was to learn how to take advantage of online APIs, in this case JSON and the Google Maps API. 

**Expression Evaluation** - Project three's goal was to write a program that takes in a real math expression, turn it into postfix notation, and evaluate it using this notation. 

**Implementation of MinHeap** - For Project 4, we had to create our own Min Heap Data Structure (not as complex as priority queue, but it does keep the Min heap ordered, and has a few simple functions such as remove, add, swap, etc.).
